          <h3>Shane Friedman - Software Engineer</h3>
          <p>
            Shane has been architecting and building complex user-facing systems
            for his entire career. After working on content management systems
            and dashboards for Amazon Music and YouTube Music, he led the New
            York Times engineering team responsible for the collaborative rich
            text editor that the newsroom used to produce stories for
            nytimes.com. He has worked in small, rapidly moving startup
            environments as well as large tech giants, and knows how to work
            alongside product, design, and other stakeholders to come up with
            the right solution for any problem.
