!snippet There’s something off about the most popular approach to quieting React’s warnings about using layout effects during server-side rendering. Let’s break down why the warning exists, and when it really makes sense to disable it without actually addressing it.

### !!sections intro

So, recently,
[React ProseMirror](https://github.com/handlewithcarecollective/react-prosemirror)
added support for server-side rendering. If you read [my post about how React ProseMirror works](/blog/why_i_rebuilt_prosemirror_view), you may already know that React ProseMirror relies fairly heavily on
React’s _`useLayoutEffect`_ hook for reading data
from the DOM after render. And if you’re familiar with server-side
rendering, you may be familiar with what happens when you render a
component that uses _`useLayoutEffect`_ on the
server:

```
Warning: useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server, because its effect
cannot be encoded into the server renderer's output format. This will
lead to a mismatch between the initial, non-hydrated UI and the intended
UI. To avoid this, useLayoutEffect should only be used in components
that render exclusively on the client. See
https://reactjs.org/link/uselayouteffect-ssr for common fixes.
```

### !!sections breakdown

<LeadIn>It’s worth</LeadIn> breaking down what this warning is actually trying
to communicate, because it’s not especially straightforward. To start, we should
review what _`useLayoutEffect`_ is actually for. Like other React hooks,
_`useLayoutEffect`_ provides a mechanism for managing side effects. In
particular, as the name implies, layout effects are meant to be side effects
that read from the DOM, usually for the purpose of modifying the layout of a
component. To allow this, React will execute a component’s render function,
commit the changes to the DOM, and then immediately run its layout effects
_before_ the browser paints those DOM updates. This means that something like a
tooltip component can evaluate the position of its anchor in a layout effect,
update its state to reflect that position, and be re-rendered with that new
state, all without the user ever seeing the tooltip in the wrong place.

Now let’s walk through what happens when we server-side render a
component like this. Below, we have an example application that uses a
layout effect to position a tooltip:

```tsx App.tsx
import { useLayoutEffect } from "react";

export function App() {
  const [tooltipTop, setTooltipTop] = useState(0);
  const [tooltipLeft, setTooltipLeft] = useState(0);

  const anchorRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (!anchorRef.current) return;

    const rect = anchorRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
    setTooltipTop(rect.top);
    setTooltipLeft(rect.left);
  }, []);

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>Positioned Tooltip Demo</h1>
      <div ref={anchorRef} />
      <p>A tooltip should be positioned above this paragraph.</p>
      <div style={{ position: "absolute", top, left }}>This is the tooltip</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

Because we’re using a layout effect, this component will actually be
rendered twice on mount, with both renders occurring before the DOM
has even been painted once. The result is that the tooltip will be
correctly positioned on the very first paint, with the user only ever
visually seeing a DOM represented by the following HTML:

```html client.html
<article>
  <h1>Positioned Tooltip Demo</h1>
  <div></div>
  <p>A tooltip should be positioned above this paragraph.</p>
  <div style="position: absolute; top: 50px; left: 8px;"></div>
</article>
```

But what happens when we render this component on the server? There is
no DOM on the server at all, so React never executes layout effects.
Instead, the component is rendered exactly once, using the default
values for our state:

```html server.html
<article>
  <h1>Positioned Tooltip Demo</h1>
  <div></div>
  <p>A tooltip should be positioned above this paragraph.</p>
  <!-- focus(1:1) -->
  <div style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;"></div>
</article>
```

This means that in a server-side rendered context, until the
client-side JavaScript bundle is loaded, parsed, and executed, the
user will be looking at _the wrong UI_. The tooltip will simply
be in the wrong place (at _`0, 0`_). It will look
broken!

This is precisely the issue that React was trying to warn us about.
Because effect hooks don’t execute on the server at all, server-side
rendered UIs that rely on them may appear broken until they’re
hydrated on the client. Following the link from the warning message
takes us to a GitHub Gist with two proposed solutions: replacing the _`useLayoutEffect`_ with a
_`useEffect`_, and conditionally rendering the component
that uses _`useLayoutEffect`_ only on the client. For our
tooltip example, we should use the second option — it’s better to simply not
render the tooltip at all until the client-side JavaScript has a chance to run
and determine where it should be positioned.

### !!sections isomorphic-layout-effect

<LeadIn>Not all layout effects</LeadIn> actually need to _modify_ the layout,
though. React ProseMirror, for example, uses layout effects internally to
maintain ProseMirror’s view descriptor tree, which is roughly analogous to
React’s virtual DOM. Because this requires _reading_ from the DOM, but not
modifying it, it’s actually safe to include in a server-side rendered component.
But it’s a huge pain to fill up users’ server logs with warnings about
_`useLayoutEffect`_ that they can’t (and don’t need to) do anything about!

If you’ve been around the server-side rendering block once or twice,
you can probably see where this is going. The
use-isomorphic-layout-effect library, or other implementations of it
available from other popular libraries, is often the first tool that
developers reach for when they encounter this warning. Let’s take a
look at its implementation:

```ts use-isomorphic-layout-effect/src/index.ts
import { useEffect, useLayoutEffect } from "react";

import isClient from "#is-client";

export default isClient ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect;
```

          Very simple! The library only runs
          _`useLayoutEffect`_ if the code is running on the
          client (in the browser, this determined via
          _`typeof document !== "undefined"`).
          On the server, instead, it runs… _`useEffect`,
          instead? That’s sort of odd. Effects never execute on the server — why
          would we bother running _`useEffect`_ there?

          And it’s not just this library that’s made this somewhat odd choice of
          no-op. Here’s react-use’s implementation:

```ts react-use
const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect = isBrowser ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect;
```

The Mantine design system:

```ts mantine
export const useIsomorphicEffect =
  typeof document !== "undefined" ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect;
```

React Beautiful DnD:

```ts react-beautiful-dnd
const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect =
  typeof window !== "undefined" &&
  typeof window.document !== "undefined" &&
  typeof window.document.createElement !== "undefined"
    ? useLayoutEffect
    : useEffect;
```

In case it’s not clear why I’m so fascinated by this choice, here’s
React ProseMirror’s implementation:

```ts useClientLayoutEffect.ts"
import { useLayoutEffect } from "react";

export function useClientLayoutEffect(
  ...args: Parameters<typeof useLayoutEffect>
) {
  if (typeof document === "undefined") return;

  useLayoutEffect(...args);
}
```

This implementation has _precisely_ the same behavior as the
implementations above. On the client, it calls
_`useLayoutEffect`_, and on the server, it does
nothing. I didn’t name it “isomorphic”, because it’s not really
isomorphic — at least in the sense of “Isomorphic JavaScript”, which
describes JavaScript code that runs on both the client and the server
— as it doesn’t run on the server at all!

### !!sections conclusion

<LeadIn>Just to be clear</LeadIn>, this doesn’t _really_ matter. I’m not arguing
that no one should ever use use-isomorphic-layout-effect, or that all of these
libraries need to change their implementations of this function to use an
explicit no-op instead of _`useEffect`_ on the server. I _am_, however, curious
about where this surprisingly ubiquitous quirk of the React ecosystem came from.
And I have a hypothesis.

In February of 2019, the React team released React 16.8, the first
stable release of React that included hooks. Two months later, React
Redux released their v7, which included a new hooks-based integration
between React and Redux.
[And wouldn’t you know it](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/commit/96fec159e2afb8649321d8cd61841b9cf406ae8f#diff-9f098d970b2879a8b6675a3aea9ece3ea36c2c0d1bdfb7008f2739cda236b839R35-R281):

```js connectAdvanced.js"
// React currently throws a warning when using useLayoutEffect on the server.

// To get around it, we can conditionally useEffect on the server (no-op) and
// useLayoutEffect in the browser. We need useLayoutEffect because we want
// \`connect\`_ to perform sync updates to a ref to save the latest props after
// a render is actually committed to the DOM.
const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect =
typeof window !== 'undefined' ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect

...

// We need this to execute synchronously every time we re-render. However, React warns
// about useLayoutEffect in SSR, so we try to detect environment and fall back to
// just useEffect instead to avoid the warning, since neither will run anyway.
useIsomorphicLayoutEffect(() => {
```

Make sure to read those comments — the React Redux team seems fully
aware that _`useEffect`_ is a mere no-op here.
React Beautiful DnD’s implementation actually directly references this
React Redux code. Other implementations likely either copied from one
of these two popular libraries, or from
[this Medium post from a few weeks later](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/uselayouteffect-and-ssr-192986cdcf7a).

From what I can tell, a very popular, well maintained library made an
early, arbitrary implementation decision. Because copying this library
felt like a safe bet to other library maintainers, this arbitrary
decision became the de facto implementation for this workaround. A
Medium post about this implementation became so widely read that it’s
still the number one Google result for the query “useLayoutEffect ssr
warning”, several slots above the GitHub Gist discussing the correct
solution for most use cases.

### !!sections why-it-matters

<LeadIn>Even though I had an explanation</LeadIn>, this kept itching at me. This
is partly due to the description of the use-isomorphic-layout-effect library,
which reads:

> A React helper hook for scheduling a layout effect with a fallback
> to a regular effect for environments where layout effects should not
> be used (such as server-side rendering).

There is no mention here that _`useEffect`_ is a
mere no-op in those situations. It also seems to describe the problem
space somewhat incorrectly — if a given layout effect actually should
not be used in server-side rendering, then the component using it
almost certainly should not be server-side rendered at all. Falling
back to a plain effect in that situation is precisely as incorrect as
using a layout effect — only without a warning to guide you toward the
correct solution.

react-use’s _`useIsomorphicLayoutEffect`_ hook
has a somewhat more accurate description:

> _`useLayoutEffect`_ that does not show warning
> when server-side rendering, see
> [Alex Reardon’s article](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/uselayouteffect-and-ssr-192986cdcf7a)
> for more info.

But it also lacks any detail about when it’s appropriate to use this
hook in place of _`useLayoutEffect`_. And, worse,
on the main README for react-use, the description for the hook reads:

> _`useLayoutEffect`_ that that [sic] works on
> server.

Which is not correct. This hook, like all other “isomorphic” layout
effect hooks, has exactly the same behavior as
_`useLayoutEffect`_, minus the warning. It does
not work on the server!

### !!sections takeaways

<LeadIn>I may be reading far too much into this very scant story</LeadIn>, but I
began to see a narrative unfold the further I looked into this:

A maintainer for a very popular open source library, in the midst of a
big refactor, made an essentially arbitrary decision to work around a
noisy warning that wasn’t relevant to their use case. They seem to
have done this with full knowledge that their decision was arbitrary,
and left a comment explaining it.

Another maintainer for a similarly popular open source library also
needed to work around the warning, which was similarly irrelevant to
their use case. They saw this workaround and decided to copy it as-is,
leaving only link to the original (which has since been replaced) as
explanation.

A developer, frustrated by the warning, found these libraries’
workaround and authored a short blog post touting it as a way to quiet
the warning. They seem to at least somewhat misunderstand the purpose
of the warning (or maybe they fully understand it, but didn’t fully
explain), and don’t clarify in their post that the choice of
_`useEffect`_ is essentially arbitrary.

As more developers migrated to use React hooks, more developers ran
into this warning and began searching for solutions. Some of them
published the solution from Reardon’s blog post in their own
libraries, and others found Reardon’s post and implemented his
approach themselves.

At each step in the saga, there’s less and less context. Even though
the warning itself links to a GitHub Gist that explains the issue and
solutions quite well, searching the language of the warning will
retrieve Reardon’s post and other solutions before the linked Gist
from the React team.

As a result, the de facto solution to this “problem” doesn’t have
sufficient context for users to understand how to use it effectively.
The hugely popular
[React-Select library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-select), for example,
[incorrectly uses use-isomorphic-layout-effect](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/blob/53b85346bb7defd937257b0daf9d6993ef20a59a/packages/react-select/src/components/Menu.tsx#L335-L364)
to position and scroll a menu, when it should instead avoid rendering
the menu on the server at all. And I’m not trying to pick on
React-Select — it seems likely that this is almost never an actual bug
for them, since menus are likely always collapsed during the server
render. But that is precisely the use case that the React team had in
mind when they added the _`useLayoutEffect`_
warning!

To me at least, this is a reminder of why it’s important to understand
_why_ our code does what it does. It can be tempting to sit
back and let sleeping dogs lie after finally finding the solution to a
confounding bug. But it’s all too easy for those incomplete
understandings to build up and slowly shift our intuition over time,
until we find that our mental model of our problem space doesn’t match
reality any longer.

Oh, and React ProseMirror doesn’t trigger the layout effect warning
during server-side rendering anymore!
